# Scripts folder

This is the folder where the scripts go.

Depending on the number of scripts, you could create additional subdirectories.

## Publishing

If you intend to publish your scripts to public repository, then it might be
advisable to create separate folder for every published script.  Then you can
add release notes document to every script (instead of keeping them inside the
script).

## Housekeeping

You can safely remove this readme after creating your first function.
